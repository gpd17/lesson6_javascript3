### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned the DOM HTML elements. The two elements include methods and properties. Methods are actions you can perform whereas properties are values that you can set or change. 
2. Like HTML, a JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs. The code for it is onclick=JavaScript.
3. I also learned about nodes. In order to add a new element to the HTML DOM, you must first create a node, then add it to an existing element.
